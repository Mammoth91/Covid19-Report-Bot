Countries, territories or areas with reported confirmed cases of COVID-19, 12March 2020SUBJECT IN FOCUS: Clinical Case Management-updateThe Clinical Unit continues to convene clinicians around the globe, twice weekly by teleconference (COVID-19 Clinical Network)to share knowledge and experiences from clinicians caring for COVID-19 patients and highlight operational challenges and technical questions. There are over 30 countries represented on this call.The major clinical challenge reported is the severity of the disease.A recent surge in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation has strained some health systems and exhausted biomedical supplies and staff.This has highlighted the need to better support health systems become ready for such a surge in cases.Thus, the team alongside our logistic colleagues and partners are developing a Clinical Concept of Operations intended to guide countries with surge decision -making, and tools to accelerate the availability of oxygen and biomedical equipment.In addition, the Clinical unit is regularly updating other products for clinical case management:\bullet The updated Clinical Management Guidance for COVID-19. This will include more detailed information about the care of patients with mild and severe illness, young children,pregnant and postpartum women and information about breastfeeding.To be released on 13 March 2020.\bullet TheWHO Clinical Care Training materialscontinue to be available onopenwho.org.This covers an approach to clinical care from pre-triage/triage, diagnosis/testing and critical care interventions, such as lung protective ventilation.\bullet The Global COVID-19 Clinical Data Platformcontinues to collect core clinical data from hospitalized patients to inform understanding of clinical natural history and severity.SURVEILLANCETable1.Confirmedand suspectedcases of COVID-19acute respiratory disease reported by provinces, regions and cities in China, Data as of 12March2020Province/ Region/ CityPopulation (10,000s)In last 24 hoursCumulativeConfirmed casesSuspected casesDeathsConfirmed casesDeathsHubei59178210677813056Guangdong1134631013568Henan9605100127322Zhejiang573700012151Hunan689900010184Anhui63240009906Jiangxi46480009351Shandong100471007606Jiangsu80510006310Chongqing31020005766Sichuan83410005393Heilongjiang377300048213Beijing21540504358Shanghai242401903443Hebei75560003186Fujian39410002961Guangxi49260002522Shaanxi38640012452Yunnan48300101742Hainan9340101686Guizhou36000001462Tianjin15600401363Shanxi37180001330Hong Kong SAR7459001293Gansu26372001272Liaoning43590001251Jilin2704000931Xinjiang2487000763Ningxia688000750Inner Mongolia2534000751Taipei and environs2359200491Qinghai603000180Macao SAR66000100Xizang34400010Total142823263311809813173Table2.

Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.\'87Case classifications arebased on WHO case definitionsfor COVID-19.\f0\'a7Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may besubject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category forwhich there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.Terms: -Community transmissionis evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through sentinel samples (routine systematic testing of respiratory samples from established laboratories).-Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.-Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases havebeen acquired outside the location of reporting.  -Under investigationindicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.-Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined)**\ldblquote Territories \rdblquote include territories, areas,overseas dependencies and other jurisdictions of similar statusFigure 2.Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19cases reportedoutside of China(n=44 067), bydate of reportand WHO region through12March2020STRATEGIC OBJECTIVESWHO\rquote s strategic objectives for this response are to:\f1\bullet Interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread*;\bullet Identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;\bullet Identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;\bullet Address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;\bullet Communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;\bullet Minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases, identification and follow up ofthe contacts, infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the populationand risk communication.PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE\bullet To view all technical guidance documentsregarding COVID-19, please go to this webpage.\bullet WHO has developed interim guidance forlaboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus,risk communication and community engagementand Global Surveillance for human infection with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).\bullet WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a guidance document to provide advice tocabin crewand airport workers, based on country queries. The guidance can be found on the IATA webpage. \bullet WHOhasbeeninregularanddirectcontactwithMemberStateswherecaseshavebeenreported.WHO is also informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.\bullet WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnosticsand virology, clinical care and treatment, infection prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated regularly.\bullet WHO has preparedadisease commodity packagethat includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.\bullet WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans.\bullet WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.\bullet WHO has activatedtheR&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics,vaccines, and therapeutics.\bullet OpenWHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found here. Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics: A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available inArabic, English,French, Chinese, Spanish,Portuguese, and Russian); Critical Careof Severe Acute Respiratory Infections(available in English and French); Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases -ePROTECT(available inEnglish,French, and Russian); Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)(available in English and Russian); and COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response.\bullet WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillanceand case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19,help understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and toinform operational models for implementation of countermeasures such as case isolation, contacttracing and isolation.Several protocols are available here.One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the \ldblquote First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection\rdblquote ). The protocol is designed to gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health guidance to manage cases and reducethepotential spread and impact of infection.RECOMMENDATIONS AND ADVICEFOR THE PUBLICIf you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading orhave not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is spreading orhave not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak.  G et the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions (see Frequently Asked Questions). Seek guidance from WHO, your healthcare provider, your national public health authority or your employer for accurate informationon COVID-19 and whether COVID-19 is circulating where you live. It is important to be informed of the situation and take appropriate measures to protect yourself and your family (see Protection measures for everyone).If you are in an area where there are casesof COVID-19 you need to take the risk of infection seriously. Follow the advice of WHO and guidance issued by national and local health authorities. For most people,COVID-19 infectionwill cause mild illnesshowever, it can make some people very ill and, in some people, itcan be fatal. Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease or diabetes) areat risk for severe disease (See Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading).CASE DEFINITIONSWHO periodically updates the Global Surveillance for human infection with coronavirus disease (COVID-19)document which includes case definitions. For easy reference, case definitions are included below. Suspect caseA.A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g., cough, shortness of breath), AND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation AND a history of travel to or residence in a country/area or territory reporting local transmission (See situation report) of COVID-19 disease during the 14 days prior to symptom onset.ORB.A patient withany acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms;ORC.A patient with severe acute respiratory infection (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease (e.g., cough, shortness breath) AND requiring hospitalizationAND with no other etiology that fully explains the clinical presentation.Probable caseA suspect case for whom testing for COVID-19 is inconclusive. \bullet Inconclusive being the result of the test reported by the laboratoryConfirmed caseA person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. \bullet Information regarding laboratory guidance can be found here.\f0\par
